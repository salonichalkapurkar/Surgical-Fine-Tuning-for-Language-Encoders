Break up and be firm about. You’ve already admitted to being dishonest. Why lead him on?
That would look enormous if [NAME] ordered it!
I’m not a fan of that hire at all... I’m also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
Thats absolutely disgusting.
"No, that looks h*ckin delicious "
"Don't listen to the idiot, we love your posts!"
Ha! Getting him back with his own schtick!
Open a ticket and wait. These next two weeks will be very telling. All we can do is wait.

There is also no dog in the white house. Why? Because dogs can smell an asshole a mile away.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings.
Lmao I hope I’m not the only one who gets this

This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
My boy [NAME] <3
Wow! Now that's some propaganda we could use more of!
They seceded because [NAME] was elected despite not appearing on any slave owning states. How is this anything but under representation of ideology.
Yes! My Big Fat Fabulous Life
Author thinks that a guy who bounced back and forth between a bench role and AAA will bounce back and forth between a bench role and AAA.
"Ironically, I just sense that they are working in an area where this is a ready stream of revenue just waiting for them."
My mom used to think [NAME] was the handsomest NFL coach for what that’s worth.
No if anything the exact opposite. Couldn’t be further from the truth
Sorry your right
"Well, 1/2 has been done already!"
I trust Safeway over Great Canadian Superstore for my meats. I know I'm not alone in that regard. Safeway has some pretty good cheaper meats.
I missed that part unfortunately
Market ≠ Capitalism Just because something operates within the Capitalist system doesn't make it Capitalist. Just because [NAME] was (supposedly) elected didn't make him democratic
"Takes all characteristics, good and bad "
This.. im sorry but this is a dumb reply. Ofc it was fake kindness golly

"Well I'm trying to improve, man "
Thanks a bunch <3
I just want tk be a random scumbag
Very possible but there's absolutely zero indication were working on a deal to trade [NAME] currently. We're not just going to trade him away for peanuts.
I agree that you need more time in the later turns. But most games it feels like people wait until it is their turn to start thinking.
Hopefully you saved that letter!
LIGHT THE BEACONS!
Would I love to be a fly on your wall right now and watch this whole debacle.
How do you know this?
"What do you think women do? I’m quiet as a churchmouse when I mastrubate, too"
"That's what they want though. So if you really want to 'win' their battles, simply ignore them :)"
He keeps saying this in my playthrough when that's definitely NOT what I'm doing. I just suck at hunting!!
One dumbass who hasn’t watched Hereditary complaining about meaningless awards on the Internet means... eh. I lost my point. Go watch Hereditary
This was so touching ❤️❤️❤️
"Has he done this with other world leaders, too? Or only [NAME]?"
Wait... dogs can’t use ladders!
That’s just fucked lol talk about cheap.
What the fuck is this about?
"You could notice he was a little bit nervous, i think that was the main reason for his way of playing in this game."
I didn't realise this was happening! Thank you! It was hard to tell from OPs photo what the changes were
She does NOT love you. Try to ask yourself why you are accepting this treatment.
Lol omg yesssss. Probably the best suggestion anyone ever told me 🙌🏼
Wich stinks for you
Why would I do that?
"Another day, another Newsweek article reporting what some commentator said on TV."
Thanks so much for the advice! Will definitely keep that in mind
"Subscribed to sjwstories, thanks for informing me about that one!"
I wonder if truly might be work stress. He works long hours at a prestigious law firm. I need to five him more credit.
I like this feeling
Trusting readers is something we cannot afford in this day and age.
"Not really, just wanted to know why specifically you thought he was on gear. (Because I honestly don't see it)"
Don't include me in this us! Just kidding.. We need some love and fast.
Why would they stop magicking away their shit. That seems more practical than a giant plumbing network.
[NAME] can’t hurt us anymore.
You beat nerfed [NAME]. Sounds like tier lists do matter.

You shut your mouth

Oof that’s terrible
Which side story? Thanks for the info!
People like you with premature ejaculation and poor hygiene should not write long posts. Am I doing it right?
If only buses had lights or something
"yikes I am not reading that, the napkins are over there sir, have a nice day"
"No, it's not that one"
ah maybe next time
Well someone posted the ingredients in the comments below. I’m still new to the whole vegan thing.
You're in luck!

Well if you read my other posts you’d know I did try to end it in a responsible mature way and he refused sooo
"Awesome, love the input! I totally get what you’re saying!"
I would hate to see another [NAME] situation where [NAME] gets hurt again because he wasn't fully recovered.
Much love half purple homie
Molon labe!!!
The [NAME] did send his only son to score for our Pens! We are REDEEMED!
I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.
Must be a tough life when all you can think about is sad stories to keep you from enjoying anything.
Should I watch this? Will it aggravate me?
I believe in you. Do what is right for you. I hope you feel better soon too. ♥️🙂
That was one of the things that I didn't think about and I already gave a delta for that.
That's sad. I'm 16 and where I am there are loads of athiests my age. It's great.

It’s a terrible thing when someone who doesn’t let themselves laugh has a reddit account

"Did anyone else read this and say ""Fuck yeah!""?"
"I'll pass the ""I'm not crying you're crying!"" part. Yeah I'm crying. "
Thank you very much I appreciate the enthusiasm btw do you know more or less how much space will I need to install it?
Oh ok that makes sense then! Thanks for taking the time to explain. 😊
That specific block is probably one of the worst in the city.
When is the battle point for squad spawning back?
He’s a way worse version of [NAME]. I don’t think anyone is putting him in their top 15 besides Bears fans.
You're disgusting
1. Use chicken thighs 2. Dryness doesn't matter with this much fat.
"Exactly. We’re only here for the money, assholes. "

Personal insults aren't allowed around here. 1 week ban for first offense.
I've been watching it recently and it is such an amazing show!
Why would you mention [NAME]? Lol
Don’t tempt me!
I hope you get the help you need. Truly.
Not sure if we can call him ginger anymore. That hairline went into a recession that'd put 2009 to shame.
I love this ahahah
U guys are like match made in heaven ♥️♥️♥️
Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
"First [NAME], now [NAME]. Stop the conks. Please. "

thats some very advanced way of thinking - and I dont think I was able to do that when I was 18
Mmmmm tasty 🅱️estrogens
Damn. I'm sorry. What misery.
Oh interesting username
Thank you for saying this. It is disrespectful to me. And it hurts.
You should've smashed his head into it.
Looks like emotionally and physically beating the shit out of his wife and children was not wasted then.
> don't tax anyone what a stupid idea.
Before telling you anything....what exactly do you want out of this?
I just tell myself that I'll be put together for some girl. She won't have to treat me like a fixer upper.
The only cringe is some of y'all obsessing over every little thing Eureka does.
Don’t wait. Take control of your life back and leave. You know that’s what’s going to happen.
"Aww, thank you [NAME] for capturing me!!"
Ohh.. Thank you!
And *they are the ones* talking about NPCs!
Well thanks for sharing. I loved it. Do you know of any others from them that aren't well known?
Petey ot [NAME]. Let's go. Hockey gods cannot forsake us this much
And yet it looks like one thing you can't is read. Shame shame.
Shit you are right! I can't believe I forgot to mention that as well! Thanks for pointing that out ;)
I get wound up over completely imagined conversations too 😅 I'm trying to meditate and learn to stop myself from going down the rabbit hole.

Dummy I'm disagreeing with you
"I would try rubbing alcohol, high percentage. Looks greasy to me."
"Gross. I hate using those reusable cloth ones because they retain smells. You've got cats? I know, I can smell them. "
I don't know any but my own I'm afraid.
Most valuable comment
"[NAME], learn some fucking grammar and punctuation. Maybe use some paragraphs. Just an idea."
Yeah. If you try not to ignore the photos it's right there.
This internet stranger is also super proud of you! Way to go!!!
"Man, I assumed it was already out and I'd missed it."
Idiots are downvoting your correct comment.
If that’s true it’s very desperate. You would think he had some better way of communicating.
I believe that you can search for providers here. Good luck and good on ya.
Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.
Nah I dont think the panthers are good enough
[NAME] what a dork you are to think the above comment means I am daft to the behavior endured by women for way too long.
It's cool.
I came here to say this.
"Oh man, what was the name of that show. It feels so familiar. Haven't watched MTV in, I don't know, 15 years? "

"Not at all. It's great of course for financial reasons, but it then makes me worried about how much time she'll have for a relationship."
I agree!!! His character has grown so much throughout the entire series and I was very disappointed that he ended up with her.
"Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary "
[NAME] didn't want to deal with [NAME] (reasonable) and [NAME] had more foreign policy experience and credentials than [NAME] did at the time.

[NAME] vs. Being an actual coach
Probably the most rational way to look at this entire scenario - thanks for posting this my dude. That comment set me straight again.
"I provoked by breathing too hard. And yes, I hate that. "
Someone made a similar joke and got 500 down votes.
[NAME] was a great coach
Fuuuuuck. That’s the worst I’ve seen.
It is. You generally need 5 down and 5 up to play reliably. Also wired.
"[NAME] that website is cancer. Also I love how the main ""entertainment"" in it is straight up harassment."
This is really cool and well made!
Surprise my what now?
I will always love ohare because it is the home alone airport
Go play Farmville if you can't keep it up.
"He is nearly 25, can't shoot, can't dribble and does nothing great. He wont improve much."
So [NAME] is really a fan of playing the bench vs the other team's starters at the end of halves. Really finding every tanking edge possible.
"yeah, those seem like they'll flop around quite safely... "
"Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol."
I'm here again to say I love your art and it brings me joy when you post it on this sub bye!

This is amazing
"It looks like how [NAME] is introducing the comedians in ""Whose line is it anyway ?"""

Adoration is definitely something I could do more of. Thank you!
That’s pretty accurate
Also one of my favorite parts of this story.
What was the end result of this?
They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
"looks cool, i want it now."
The applause came from [NAME] and his group.
"Um, excuse me? I'm a *rolling* rabbit hole, thank you"
In the first combo if you just do the b+k instead of even bothering to kick it does 1 more damage Not much obviously but yeah just a thought
I don't find anything about women appealing.
"-30°, then again I'm only 16. Been a while since these temps have come around so it's not pleasant."

Got a good laugh out of that. Plenty of wall of shame material.
FYI… the [NAME] has these in their kitchen in “ That 70s Show.”

Sorry I'm a reddit noob but why do I get notifications of comments on my thread but then they disappear and I can't read them? Lol
Wonder how he feels about [NAME] now
Triple single son
Folks are complaining about the new buses.
[NAME] boxing gym in Ross is super inviting to everyone! It's a legit boxing club that is also friendly to folks just looking for a workout.
What made you so interested in great whites?
There are far more bad ones than good ones. Stepparents that treat their stepchildren as their own are noteworthy for a reason.
"""By far one of the best"" Mmmm"
Also part of the idea is that it’s nothing special. It’s just our flag. You don’t have to order something different.
It's perfectly fine
Glad I'm not the only one
Dude the speed which the cop came running is amazing
It's realistically his last chance to get a big payday.

Worried me there
"Bzzzzt, try again"
"I own literally no red shirts, would grey, tan, or purplish be okay?"
That's a really cheap cop-out for rather common criticism of those games.
So can we all collectively accept that [NAME] has a high placement for this week? Okay thank you
"So America and the USSR are the exact same thing to you? Sorry you're so small minded, hope you learn to grow in the future."
It’s not even news.
Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.
I've just listened to it on my way from school today! [NAME] anatomy introduced some beautiful music.
This is my ex and I rib about this all the time
Great pick! Especially when I realized she was meant to lose yesterday...good luck!
"As long as you don't kiss her whole face you will be fine. If you both want it, it shouldn't be awkward."
Hahahah this is awesome.
"Fake news! but really, that's awesome to have a parent that actually understands how to teach their child accountability. "

Help me [NAME] I'm bully in high school for no reason.
Rose coloured glasses get rosier as time goes by :) You'll move on eventually. Treasure the memory but be present in your current and future relationships.
that was so sad :(
Reminds me of [NAME] in IASIP
Fair enough. I considered it malicious compliance because I followed the letter if the rules while purposely not following the spirit.
people have built such a stigma around it that it's what comes to mind first instead of positive thoughts.
I thought that type of camouflage failed horribly because the high contrast and defined shapes made the ships really stand out.
I'd say Rick and Morty fans. I'm a fan of both but I feel that Rick and Morty fans take everything way more seriously.
"Honestly the rarity is fine, I find it once every 25 games but the health needs work. "
Seems like cutting out the middleman. They already know they are fat so no need to go to the doctor
Oh my. Bless this dog. He is a big boy. I love him so much. Tell him I love him.
I thought there's a top 5 and they filmed each elimination? What makes you say [NAME] isn't there (though I'd love [NAME] to be)
Best thing about making moonshine is the ether vapors you get to collect :)
I came.
Look like when i wake up in the same bed with my uncle
And AI will somehow be magically more disruptive than the industrial revolution. Because... reasons.
Something is eating this poor redditor and I don’t think it’s the injustice of society at large to accept face tattoos.
Have you ever consider knocking three times and that hide and seek/stalker vibe is terrifying. It's the most disturbing thing I can link you my AR 15.
> we can't john beard that big
I'm literally screaming.
Weird as I do know I've seen CoC waste/recycling services trucks picking up bins as early as 6:30AM.
[NAME] scratched again lmao. Lines are good though. Pretty optimal considering what we have imo. I like [NAME] playing with [NAME]
"Super [NAME] with a hat, or providing a buffed hat sounds really funny, if incredibly useless."

Ah to be a young teen again
This is the first time in the last two years I've seen somebody compare current politics to a series other than Harry Potter

Can’t even tell what’s happening here. This isn’t cringe.
Post the shaved [NAME] bro! #1 guard all over!
For both of us to be done school. To be in a secure spot financially.
I'm just too lazy to count a subreddit for 20 characters every time I see one
"True, but it is deceptive when dealing with c diff, it may give them a false sense of security."
Yeah thats exactly what I said. Im too weak to do it.
"Probably not, and I'm fine with that. Not exactly the position nor type of person a rebuilding team needs. "
Shut up and dance
Lmao servers in America make like $2 an hour with no tips.
That sounds really cool! I'll be there
"I was a [NAME] fan for a good bit, so that swayed me a little towards his teams"
Maybe when they get away from David cage finally the plots won't be so Melodramatic and on the nose.
Just keep going and don't lose hope. Stuff like this can happen all the time to anybody. It's just bad luck
"Oh, I see what you did... Trying to confuse me."
"Yep. I did this in uni, got mad respect for holding my ""booze"". "
"You can't see me, Vern."
You're an idiot and no one believes you and your telegram jerk-off buddies.
This is good. Thank you!
Anyone else think [NAME] talks too much in this and drowns destiny and hbomb out My man be talkin
Be single for a while and get your mind right before being with either of them or anybody else.
Chat Room or Messages??
Man you take your sims really seriously.
You’re doing so good! We’re all so proud!
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave When first we practise to deceive!"
The only one I'd recomend is [NAME] to be honest
What kind of behaviour is considered unattractive? I'm pretty clueless when it comes to dating.
You can make a complaint and get damages if this happens. They are required to not pester you for two years if you fill it in online.
I thought my [RELIGION] boarding school was weird but now it seems pretty tame and mild in comparison.
My bio is pretty funny... I got ‘If you’re a Catfish then you’ll be charged a call out fee of £120.49’
Damn [NAME] is KILLING it
"Memes that were made 2 or more years ago don’t count. They were probably funny back then, just not now."
Thank you for sharing this with us
Oh. I have anxiety for her and this conversation.
"Also, [NAME] has reached the ""retweet fans pressuring him to run"" stage of unofficially running."
Hoping LSU can kill 2 minutes and 20 seconds of clock here and not let UCF score more...
One more thing don't try to like eavesdrop or anything just kinda bring it up organically
Well it obviously helps you rationalize your total unwillingness to take action to make the world a better place. I hope that you grow past that.
I recently got a job that I wanted so now I don't have to live paycheck to paycheck.
Thanks [NAME] for winning so we don't have to see so much of [NAME] laughable career dwindling away.
Sadly no... I’m in Delaware 😩. But I’d love to help in any way I can. Keep me posted. 
Watch it! He has the diabeetus.
Holy fuck. Best idea ever. Thank you.
That facial hair....guy just finished playing red dead redemption 2 probably
good news is his fall was cushioned by [NAME] soft hairy body

[NAME] will have to redeem himself by getting a hatty. LGP!
Guice was a fuckin monster.
Just take them and get them vaccinated without his knowledge. Only one parent is needed. Dont even tell him after it's done.
"Yeah, be sure to choose an option that won't be painful and has no chance of survival. And make it quick."
This is really helpful to point out!!
"nah it takes it a lot more than one time, I reckon you'll be fine considering your aware of the risk"
I'm in the UK dude. It's happening everywhere and most people are either busy hating or living in a bubble so are oblivious.
"I see you with Zangetsu, and I like it"
Because physical contact promotes bonding. Healthy relationships increase both partner's wellbeing. Routine can be frustrating. Especially when you want to try something new.

When you insult someone you might want to start by insulting them to where they can understand what you're trying to say...who givES A fuck .
[NAME] will be livid if he does not get a burger but see [NAME] stuffing his face.
I'm surprised he survived the primary.
The altcoin thread!? This is the first time I've seen it in 6 months.
"Can we not say ""Team [NAME]"" or ""Team [NAME]"" etc. That's too close to us style politics for my likes..."
The cognitive dissonance is strong with you.
I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.

Not a fan of Hot Space. I like one song on there and that's Under Pressure.
I love it! It’s strangely charming lol!!! Especially when she comes back to camera speaking normally.
Having a good list of alternatives would be something great we could produce
The must be on the prowl because I've been getting these calls a lot lately.

"Gotta love how ""QUESTIONING"" is front and center in the list of things these warriors for [NAME] consider brainwashing."
Imma say this didn’t happen
Soooo [NAME] is f**ked
Intp:(
Just report his comments let the mods take care of this misogynistic twit
"[NAME] has had this problem forever. Hopefully she fixes it, because it gets old and is a relationship killer "
They're a Queens family. [NAME] would be one of those dudes who sits outside of Bodegas and bothers high school girls when they walk by.

"[NAME] sub, dolphins sub, and [NAME] subs are having a field day right now lol same old jets"
Your heart stopping is technically a natural cause.
"How about texts between them? ""On my way home."" ""Ok, see you soon."""
I'm not too excited to see [NAME] and [NAME] throwback offense again. Run 3 times punt and play great defense. Zzzzzz.
Is this a real thing? I'm a terrible stoner.
Probably also saves money. An extra 3 napkins you dont use each time multiplied by thousands of people per day adds up quick
Idk why you’re getting down voted I also pick it every time and almost always get it done on that initial skirmish
Congrats! How long was the journey? Did you stick with [NAME] the entire time?

You could always try the too faced born this way foundation. It has 40 shades now and it’s hydrating.
fat people want to be oppressed so badly. I guess it's because they need an excuse to emotionally eat.
[NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] podcast is great.
"No one ever laid on their death bed and said, “I regret not working even harder.”"

You know it’s bad when you grab the toothpaste and start reading it
"Who was it? I got here after it was deleted, and I'd like to read the comment history."
"On reflection I might've been harsh on [NAME], but Bandai's existence was forgettable like a swing flashback in Naruto."
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
And then everyone clapped
I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.
Thanks for the P.S
This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.
Didn't that used to be the Northern Bank building? Never been troubled by pickpockets in Bangor but probably because I looked too poor!

Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it and I hope you're doing better now!
That dad must love monster high as well.
I’m curious what is their concern and their purpose to be plus-size people influencers regarding the fact that they do not belong to that group?
Watching [NAME] flip his head back every poke of contact is possibly the most frustrating thing to watch
Also them dealing with mean and petty people especially in school
"Okay. I mean 18% of the words in the comment you replied to were ""Times"", but okay"
Street Samurai Koji and Ojiisan Koji are my personal favorites. Greased Lightning Koji is pretty fun as well.

So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
"Yes, I’m sure [NAME] biggest concern is New Japan getting criticism on Reddit."
Why do you keep going back the them? Why should care about hillbillies?
The first sentence alone sums it all up 😂
He was only thrown in there so we could have [NAME] get heroically saved by him and so we would hate [NAME]

That’s an insult!! To fecal matter.

Before the trade happened I knew [NAME] was [NAME] but [NAME] beauty had not reached me yet
That’s horrible. What country? If you don’t mind. My [NAME] was abused by her heavily religious (Pentecostal) father.
I thought they held hands while they and [NAME] were watching TV ([NAME] was pretending to be sick in that episode)?
I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.

Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.

"Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish."
Highgate Hill! Close to westend and has a lot of cute houses. :)
Right now I’d have to say [NAME] new restaurant UB Preserve is my favorite place to eat. So good.

His entire face is covered by a beard and sunglasses lol
PLANT LOCAL WILDFLOWERS!!!! They come back year after year and the Pollinators will Love it.
Totally agree with you. Just saying that [NAME] is not a stupid person. A smart person that will be spending the rest of his life in prison
"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."
Yes - thank you for stating it this way - perfectly said.
Congrats!!! Happy for you.
Pretty sure the legislature needs to change laws
"Oh dear, I'm so sorry you are going through this. I don't have any sage advice but I hope things get better for you."
Yeah this is pretty eye opening. I’ve had pretty weird relationships with my reflection in the past but thankfully it’s not always this way.
"Nope, from Nebraska why? Lmao"
Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to achieve a political goal. [NAME] has not used violence.
TIL I learned there are no drugs or violent incidents in prisons.

"My feelings exactly. First thought, a sarcastic 'Thanks.'"
the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.
[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
2 more trae assists pls another 3 would be delightful as well
So happy for you :)
"BT In the commentary booth: ""Where's your god [NAME]?"" As she's being mauled by a lion"
It’s a facepalm just for the wrong reason
"Because there's such a thing as ""too good to be true"" and some people are still skeptical of that."
He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.
Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
I’m just worried about his attitude and approach with younger players. Edit-re worded
This is really well put. I saved it.
Thank you. ❤️ I really appreciate your comment
I've seen so many of these and I still have a massive amount of difficulty believing it is possible.
Why so much green though lol
Unemployed now re: those crummy health issues. So that probably helped.
Sounds fun from what I’m reading on here.
"Just wait till they see what British capitalists have in store for them now we got ""arr soverinity"" back"

I wouldn't say age would stop it just lessen the affect of it but probably start to notice it around mid to late 30's.
You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.

"He looked so shlubby on that show, it was like he was the [NAME] version of [NAME]."
I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
And look like big tracts of land.
The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.
Big ol fesh
"No problem, glad to help."
Honestly you should have gone nuclear on him
I love [NAME] and how openly she is in supporting him to run
How many hours of maintenance do they really need to do every night? I feel like they just want to cut costs and tell us it's impossible.

Really good point here. Thanks.
"Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?"
Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.
Id rather have them be physically ok and make amends with [NAME] later than have one without the ability to communicate efficiently forever but have their feelings alright.
You're cool
No problem. If you read it let me know what you think!
"They put him on a minutes restriction for some reason, guessing cause he's not in really good shape?"

Thanks! I had a more standard name but then realized I didn't want to be findable on Reddit.
"""I SAID, [NAME]!"""
[NAME] is a hungry little bastard.
I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.
His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.
"Meh, it just keeps players from diving in taking stupid damage. (At least it should.)"
I’d love an ג׳‬וליאן if you have time! Good job keep up the hard work
Attempt to con the senate. This should continue to be entertaining
It’s not satisfying at all. If this wasn’t [NAME] it wouldn’t be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.
"Same boat here, man."
What a baby...
Yeah I think it largely depends on how you fall. In Judo that’s one of the main things they practice.
And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.
Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.
I never understood the point of parole. Seems to me like an expensive way to increase recidivism.
No way society should pay for your child when you are perfectly capable.
"Lol he was actually roasting OG fans that lick his arse, not [NAME] himself. Take the upvote."
AA is BS as a whole. Meritocracy or GTFO.
Thought this was r/monkeyspaw for a sec. Mind if I grant your wish anyway?
"Awesome, let's celebrate! Send the free pack over here ;)"
This says more about what [NAME] thinks about facts than what's true about music.
"And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords."
"His wounds weren’t that bad, but probably got infected. Antibiotics fixed him. Good as new. "
"Yes of mine worry, no one liked mine either. "
This sub absolutely gets personal within seconds of anything he says being postes

Lol. Thanks for the link.
Not as nice as [NAME].
Love is war
I met him! He graduated from my high school and came back when I was a freshman to talk to us in PE. Really nice guy.
It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.
"Idk, r/Tinder has plenty of posts to do with awful men too lol"
Wait one of the posters responding is using makeup from ten years ago.

i know the feeling dude
"> His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent"
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.
Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
"Weird flex, but ok"
Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
"Or better yet, on the woman who will let ME play with them!"
Yah that's what is stopping me. I would have to wire all throw my car or go into my cars electrical which doesn't seem worth it.
Can we all pitch in and buy this place instead of the Baltimore House?
Dirt bar downtown is pretty sweet.
Such season 1 vibes and I love it.
"Lol, like I said, not everything is about you"
He looks like a model tbh. Very good looking man.
Me me big sad.
Can holiday just stop fucking shooting? I can’t wait till he gets traded.
And you assume they are part of the dominant culture because of the color of their skin. That is self evident racism.

Hey what a coincidence so is a human head!

It was squirting all over my kitchen n the nurse. Who then said oh nicked an artery.

I despise [NAME] and all his cronies
"If you feel like venting, I am happy to listen."
looks like we got a double win today!!
"Don’t do a long distance thing, not worth it and a waste of time"
Yeah I'm not arguing there isnt recreational potential though it can certainly mess you up. Doesn't help most products with dxm have other active ingredients.
Same here. I had a lot of swelling but not abnormal pain.
How illuminating.

I guess her Bad breath turned him off
I love this post. Are you with park services?
I look at him as a performer but he's still human tho.
Does [NAME] or [NAME] look happier that [NAME] chose to put his hand on [NAME] leg?
I wish more people enjoyed that sport.. when that clay explodes you get that FEEL
This makes me want to get nipple piercings but I’m too scared to :/
Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
That's not what is being contested here. Telling your kid something like this would certainly make you a bitch.
Hang on to all sorts of things just in case. Eat inexpensive food.

"[NAME] doesn't want to leave St Louis, his family is there and won't move away."

In what ways has [NAME] out-coached [NAME]? I see this all the time and yet never any examples.
She looks like her face is pulled back with ''face lifts'' tape. Or like she's pulling back her face like that scene in MIB I.
